Instruction for Claude Code — Fix VRM search suggestions UI (desktop + mobile)
Problem

The VRM search field now returns results, but the suggestions/results panel is rendering in the wrong place on desktop and mobile (overlapping content / floating in an odd position). It needs to be anchored to the search input, sized correctly, and behave like a proper combobox/autocomplete dropdown.

Requirements (must meet all)

Anchor correctly

The suggestions panel must be positioned relative to the search input container.

It should appear directly under the input, aligned left edges, with the same width as the input (or its container).

Correct layering

Ensure it appears above the board columns/cards (z-index).

It must not be hidden behind other containers (watch for overflow: hidden on parents).

Responsive behavior

Desktop: dropdown width matches the search input; max-height with scroll if many results.

Mobile: dropdown should not overflow off-screen horizontally.

If space is tight, allow the dropdown to expand to full available width of the search bar container.

Ensure padding/margins keep it readable and not clipped by viewport edges.

Interaction

Clicking a suggestion filters/sets VRM properly and closes the dropdown.

Clicking outside closes the dropdown.

Pressing Esc closes the dropdown.

Keyboard navigation (up/down + enter) should work if already implemented—if not, add it if feasible, but positioning is priority.

No visual glitches

Remove any transform/translate that is causing it to “float” mid-screen.

Ensure it doesn’t render partially off-screen or under the “Debug/+” floating button on mobile.

Debug checklist Claude should follow

Find the component that renders the VRM search input + suggestions (Stock board toolbar).

Identify how the suggestions panel is currently positioned:

If using position: fixed → change to position: absolute inside a relative wrapper.

If using a portal/popover library (Radix/Headless UI/etc.) → configure anchor/sideOffset/collisionPadding properly.

Wrap the search input in a container like:

div.relative.w-full (or appropriate width)

dropdown div.absolute.left-0.top-full.mt-2.w-full ...

Ensure parents of the dropdown do not clip it:

remove/adjust overflow-hidden where required, or render dropdown in a portal but still anchored properly.

Add z-[9999] (or consistent app layering token) to dropdown.

Test:

Desktop Chrome (normal)

Mobile Safari / Chrome device emulation

With the board scrolled horizontally and vertically

Expected outcome

Typing “X5” shows a dropdown directly beneath the search field, same width as the input, readable and clickable, no weird floating placement, and looks consistent across mobile + desktop.
