Context

We have several UI elements (tooltips + share-form drawer/modal) that render correctly on desktop but break on mobile:

Tooltips overflow / sit awkwardly (stock + submissions pages).

Share Form “drawer/modal” doesn’t fit viewport (content clipped top/bottom, URL field weird).

Stock/Aftersales tooltip says “Drag cards…” but mobile drag isn’t supported (or isn’t usable), so wording should be adaptive.

1) Fix tooltips on mobile (Stock + Submissions)
Goal

On mobile:

Tooltip should never go off-screen

Should have max width, wrap text, and reposition to stay visible.

Close button must always be reachable.

Implementation requirements

Identify the tooltip component used on:

Stock & Prep Board page

Submissions page

Update the tooltip container styles:

max-width: calc(100vw - 32px) (or Tailwind max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)])

white-space: normal; and ensure wrapping works (break-words)

Add overflow-wrap: anywhere; if needed to avoid long strings breaking layout.

Ensure tooltip is anchored correctly:

If you’re using Popper/Floating UI, enable:

shift() / flip() middleware

padding (8–12px)

If it’s a custom tooltip, implement manual positioning:

Clamp left/right to viewport bounds

Prefer “top” placement; fall back to “bottom” if near top

Ensure tooltip content area has:

max-height: 40vh (or similar) with overflow-y: auto for long tooltips.

Add a mobile-specific layout tweak:

On small screens (sm: and below), render as a compact banner / callout instead of a floating tooltip if necessary (this is often the cleanest UX):

Full-width card under the page header, with close (X) on right.

This avoids popper weirdness entirely.

✅ Deliverable: tooltips on both pages look intentional and always fit fully on screen on iPhone Safari.

2) Fix “Share Form” popup/drawer on mobile (content clipped)
Problem (from screenshot)

The Share Form UI (drawer/modal) is taller than the viewport; content gets cut off top and bottom.

Goal

On mobile:

Drawer/modal should fit within viewport height

Content should scroll inside the drawer, not behind it

Header/footer should stay accessible

Implementation requirements

Locate Share Form UI component (likely a Dialog/Drawer).

Apply a consistent “mobile safe” layout:

Container height: max-height: calc(100dvh - env(safe-area-inset-top) - env(safe-area-inset-bottom) - 16px)

Use 100dvh not 100vh (Safari address bar issues).

Ensure the drawer uses:

display: flex; flex-direction: column;

Header fixed at top

Body: flex: 1; overflow-y: auto; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;

Footer fixed or inside the scroll area depending on design

Ensure the URL field doesn’t overflow:

Use truncate / overflow-hidden text-ellipsis whitespace-nowrap

Or allow wrap but ensure it doesn’t push layout wider than viewport.

Add safe padding:

Bottom padding includes env(safe-area-inset-bottom)

Don’t let the “Print QR” button sit under the iPhone home bar.

✅ Deliverable: Share Form drawer is fully usable on iPhone; no clipped content; scroll works inside the modal.

3) Make the “Drag cards between columns” tooltip accurate for desktop vs mobile
Current issue

Tooltip says “Drag cards between columns…” but mobile either:

doesn’t support drag/drop, or

it’s not usable, or

UI is not designed for it.

Best approach

Make tooltip copy responsive / capability-based:

Logic

If user is on a device where drag-and-drop is supported (fine pointer / desktop), show:

“Drag cards between columns to update their status.”

If user is on mobile / touch (coarse pointer), show:

“Tap a card to open it and update status, tasks and issues.”

Implementation

Use media queries or runtime detection:

CSS media query: (pointer: coarse) = mobile/touch

Or JS: window.matchMedia("(pointer: coarse)").matches

Apply this to tooltips on:

Stock & Prep

Aftersales/Warranty

✅ Deliverable: desktop users see drag guidance; mobile users see tap guidance.

4) Testing checklist (must do)

iPhone Safari:

Stock page tooltip: visible, not cut off, close works

Submissions tooltip: visible, not cut off

Share Form drawer: no clipping; internal scroll works; buttons reachable

Desktop:

Tooltip still positioned nicely

Drag tooltip message remains drag-oriented on desktop

Regression check:

No horizontal scroll introduced

No z-index issues (tooltip/modal behind header etc)
