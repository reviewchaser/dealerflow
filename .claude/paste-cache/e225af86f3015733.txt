Ultrathink - With the whole new sales/invoicing modle the whole marketing home page (currently /marketing) needs redesigning, with a big emphasis on the free tier to encourage people to sign up (big potential to upside pro with all the locked features). it needs to show plans available as well Free -invoicing and basic stock management, reporting etc. Pro - All the other modules as well (£49 a month) - annual toggle to get price for £490 You say you have already created the free plan etc, change. Currently the link says free trial when it should say something like 'join free'. The sign up form is very basic, it needs the dealer to select a plan (Free - sales module only) or paid (everything). Also needs the user to fill out dealership details & address. When the form is completed it needs to say please wait for your account to be activated or someting along those lines (the free accounts can be abused). Any free accounts need only the sales module available for use, obviously they will need the stock & prep page but all the other features & image/file uploads etc within this page will be locked and inaccessible. All the other modules on the sidebar can also be clicked and show the pages but will all be read only (or you suggest better) with some text somewhere at the top saying only available in Pro plan - upgrade now. This encouages upsale - review in full before amending.
