We currently have a customer px form appraisal and a dealer appraisal form - The add part exchange fields needs to have somewhere something like 'Import from appraisals' (or something worded better), with the option to search by VRM on appraisals (only applies to customer px form submissions obviously). This way it can prefill fields AND also bring over issues etc they have raised when the deal is finalised. This will automically transfer over to the card created on the stock and prep board (issues etc). If there is no customer px appraisal then this means the dealer needs to appraise the part exchange. This can either be suggested to do at point of deposit (best time if person is on site) or at point of handover (if vehicle not present). Either way a part exchange appraisal must be completed before everything is completed on the sale. If the part exchange doesn't come or the deal is cancelled the appraisal submission will just sit on that page with the options available for future use (conver to stock, delete etc).
