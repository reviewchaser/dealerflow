Claude — thanks, the Deal lifecycle UI/endpoints sound like a solid start, but it’s not yet aligned with the full Sales module spec and it isn’t working end-to-end.

1) Fix routing (Deals page currently 404)

The sidebar link you added (“Deals”) points to a route that does not exist.

This repo uses Next.js Pages Router, so ensure the page is created under /pages/... and matches the sidebar href.

Also ensure it respects our multi-tenant routing structure (dealer slug). If the app route pattern is /app/[dealerSlug]/..., the deals page must live under that and the sidebar link must point there.
Deliverable: confirm the final canonical URL path (e.g. /app/[dealerSlug]/sales/deals) and ensure the sidebar matches it.

2) Rename navigation properly: Sales vs Deals

Top-level nav should be Sales (not Deals).

The Deals list can be the default landing page inside Sales.
Implement:

Sidebar label: Sales

Route: /app/[dealerSlug]/sales redirects to /app/[dealerSlug]/sales/deals (or renders deals list directly)

3) Add Sales/Deal integration into Stock vehicle drawer (required)

Add a “Sales” section/tab in the open vehicle drawer on Stock & Prep.
Minimum features:

Show whether a Deal exists for this vehicle + status

Buttons: Create Deal / Open Deal

If deal exists: Take Deposit / Generate Invoice / Mark Delivered / Complete (depending on state)

Links to generated documents (deposit receipt + invoice) if available

4) Confirm what’s not implemented yet

Your summary didn’t mention:

Contacts page + CRUD

Add-ons catalog (settings) + deal add-ons editing

Part exchange linking from appraisals/submissions

Reports: Stock book, VAT summary, profit KPIs

Terms templates + signatures rules + PDF pack export
Please list exactly what is implemented vs remaining so we can continue in the right order.

Do not mark the Sales module “complete” until the routing works and the Stock drawer Sales section exists.
